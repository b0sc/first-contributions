## About the Files

### README.md

This file is the first file that is displayed when you open the github repository of any project. It displays the basic information about the project. It is written in markdown language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is used to create README files, to write messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### CONTRIBUTING.md

For any popular open source project a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is a path to get started with contributing to the project. It will give basic information about how to contribute as well open pull request with templates and such.

### LICENSE

A license is a legal tool you can use to protect your open source project. It is a set of rules that people must follow if they want to use your work. It gives you the right to decide how others can use and distribute your project. It is important to choose a license because without one, the default copyright laws apply. When you select license while creating your github repository, github automatically creates `LICENSE` file.

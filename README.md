# First-Contributions

A guideline to the contribution process to streamline the journey to open-source world.

## WHAT TO DO?

Go to `Contributing.md` file and follow the steps to make your first contribution to open source world.

When editing the `contribute.json` file please follow the following guidelines:

-   **Do not** change the order of the key-value pairs or format of json object.
-   Submit your **name**, **tag** and **Github profile link** in the same format as the previous entries.
-   **Do not add** your entry at beginning or end of the file.
-   Open **Only one pull request** at a time.
-   Indentation should always be **2 spaces**.

## About the Files

### README.md

This file is the first file that is displayed when you open the github repository of any project. It displays the basic information about the project. It is written in markdown language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is used to create README files, to write messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### CONTRIBUTING.md

For any popular open source project a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is a path to get started with contributing to the project. It will give basic information about how to contribute as well open pull request with templates and such.

### LICENSE

A license is a legal tool you can use to protect your open source project. It is a set of rules that people must follow if they want to use your work. It gives you the right to decide how others can use and distribute your project. It is important to choose a license because without one, the default copyright laws apply. When you select license while creating your github repository, github automatically creates `LICENSE` file.

### **Best Practices for Open Source Contributions**

In addition to the technical steps, here are some best practices to keep in mind while contributing to open-source projects:

1. **Understand the Project**: Before making contributions, take the time to read the project’s `README`, existing issues, and pull requests to gain a clear understanding of the project’s goals.
   
2. **Follow the Coding Standards**: Each project may have its own coding style or guidelines. Adhere to them to ensure your contributions integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.
   
3. **Communicate Clearly**: When opening issues or submitting pull requests, provide clear descriptions of the problem you're solving or the feature you're implementing. Effective communication with project maintainers is key to getting your contributions accepted.
   
4. **Test Before Submitting**: Always test your code locally to ensure that it works as expected. This helps reduce the chances of introducing bugs into the project.

5. **Be Respectful**: Open source communities thrive on respect and collaboration. Engage in discussions respectfully and be open to feedback from maintainers or other contributors.

6. **Start Small**: For beginners, it's a good idea to start by fixing small issues like typos, documentation errors, or simple bugs. This helps build confidence and understanding of how the contribution process works.

Good luck! on your Open Source Journey.
